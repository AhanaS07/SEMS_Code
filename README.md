# Smart Energy Management System 

This IoT-driven project is designed to enhance energy conservation, operational efficiency, and safety in a model room setup. 

Developed collaboratively with my teammates, this system utilizes an RFID card reader for controlled access to appliances. Authorized access activates lights and fans through a motion sensor, ensuring energy usage only when needed. 

Additionally, a fire sensor provides real-time alerts in emergencies, bolstering safety. Built on a Raspberry Pi, the project involved designing and coding in Python for autonomous operation, with a focus on seamless hardware-software integration.
